## About The Project

The website is structured to be clear and informative, featuring:
* A main landing page (`index.html`) to capture interest.
* An `about.html` page to introduce myself and my process.
* A `portfolio.html` page that links to individual case studies for each project.
* A `contact.html` page to make it easy for potential clients to get in touch.
